### ðŸ“š About This Repo 

This repo is based on the book Algorithm Fundamentals by Aditya Y. Bhargava, which explains programming concepts in a relaxed way with real-world analogies. Itâ€™s a solid intro, but some of the examples are in Python. Since I prefer working in JavaScript, Iâ€™m using this space to practice those concepts in my preferred language. Youâ€™ll also find a "notes" folder with markdown files Iâ€™ve made, which are compatible with Obsidian.

> The terms and codes are in English just for practice, but the book is in Brazilian Portuguese, have fun on my journey practicing the concepts in the book :D âœ¨
